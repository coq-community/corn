(* The answer function returns an approximation of r within 10^-n.
Take the resulting integer and divide by 10^n to get the actual rational approximation.
answer is useful for because it displays a familar list of digits rather
than an unfamiliar fraction that approximate would return *)

(* Please review RealFast.v for examples on how to compute with CR *)

(* Integrate01 requires that we integrate uniformly continuous functions.
   Therefore we cannot integerate (sin : CR -> CR), we must instead
   integrate the UniformlyContinuousFunction (sin_uc : Q --> CR). *)
