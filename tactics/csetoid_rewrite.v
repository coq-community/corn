(** Definition of [csetoid_rewrite]: a rewrite tactic for setoid equality;
it rewrites within formulae of type [Prop] and [CProp], built up from
connectives [->], [and], [CAnd], [or], [COr], [iff], [Iff], [not], [Not],
[CNot], and atomic formulae [(P t)], [(R t s)], [t[=]s], [t[#]s] for
[T:CSetoid], [t,s:T], [P:(CSetoid_predicate T)], [R:(CSetoid_relation T)],
[R:(CCSetoid_relation T)]. Note that atoms are built up from predicates and
relations that are well-defined with respect to setoid equality.

Setoid terms of type [T] are terms constructed by [(f s)], [(g s s')],
[(h s s_)], where [f:(CSetoid_fun S T)], [g:(CSetoid_bin_fun S S' T)],
[h:(CSetoid_part_fun S T)], [s:S], [s':S'], [s_:(cspf_dom S T f s)];
needless to say, those setoid functions respect setoid equality.

Tactic [csetoid_rewrite] is composed of tactics [total_csetoid_rewrite] and
[partial_csetoid_rewrite]. The former is applied in case there are no partial
setoid functions present in the goal. The latter if there are. We further
explain this separation.

To define the rewrite tactic we use the method of reflection, see [1].
Because we have to deal with partial functions (see the definition of
[CSetoid_part_fun] in file [CSetoids.v]), we use %\emph{partial}%
#<em>partial</em># reflection, see [2]. Partial reflection means to have an
interpretation %\emph{relation}%#<em>relation</em># instead of an
interpretation function.

Unfortunately, we were unable to define our tactic for the most general case,
that is, for terms that contain both partial functions as well as setoid
functions whose domain(s) and co-domain are not necessarily the same.
When proving lemmas involving statements [e II^r t] (saying [t] is an
interpretation of syntactic expression [e] under the variable assigment [r],
one often needs to reason by induction over [e] and then inverting the so
obtained instances of the inductively defined [e II^rho t]. However, in the
general case where we have to deal with functions whose domain and co-domain
differ, inversion doesn't yield the desired result. Consider, for instance,
[var II^r t]. Here, we want to perform inversion and obtain [t=r], for
[var II^r r] is a defining clause of [II] and moreover the only one mentioning
[var]. However, inversion returns somthing like [<p,t> = <p,r>].
This has got to do with the so-called elimination predicate which predicts
the type of the outcome of a case analysis dependent on the destructed
variable. For more info ask the author and see his related
#<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/pipermail/coq-club/2003/001127.html">
mail</a># to the coq-club.

We opted for the next best option of using two tactics, one using total
reflection, its application being restricted to terms constructed
from total functions (domain(s) and co-domain are allowed to be distinct).
The other using partial reflection, its application being restricted to
terms built up from (partial as well as total) %\emph{operations}%
#<em>operations</em># (i.e.%\% functions whose domain(s) and co-domain are
equal).
