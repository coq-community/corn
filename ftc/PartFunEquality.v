* Equality of Partial Functions

** Definitions

In some contexts (namely when quantifying over partial functions) we
need to refer explicitly to the subsetoid of elements satisfying a
given predicate rather than to the predicate itself.  The following
definition makes this possible.
*)

Definition subset (P : IR -> CProp) : CSetoid := Build_SubCSetoid IR P.

(**
The core of our work will revolve around the following fundamental
notion: two functions are equal in a given domain (predicate) iff they
coincide on every point of that domain#. #%\footnote{%Notice that,
according to our definition of partial function, it is equivalent to
prove the equality for every proof or for a specific proof.  Typically
it is easier to consider a generic case%.}%.  This file is concerned
with proving the main properties of this equality relation.
*)

Definition Feq P (F G : PartIR) := included P (Dom F) and included P (Dom G) and
 (forall x, P x -> forall Hx Hx', F x Hx [=] G x Hx').

(**
Notice that, because the quantification over the proofs is universal,
we must require explicitly that the predicate be included in the
domain of each function; otherwise the basic properties of equality
(like, for example, transitivity) would fail to hold#. #%\footnote{%To
see this it is enough to realize that the empty function would be
equal to every other function in every domain.%}.% The way to
circumvent this would be to quantify existentially over the proofs;
this, however, would have two major disadvantages: first, proofs of
equality would become very cumbersome and clumsy; secondly (and most
important), we often need to prove the inclusions from an equality
hypothesis, and this definition allows us to do it in a very easy way.
Also, the pointwise equality is much nicer to use from this definition
than in an existentially quantified one.
*)

** Properties of Inclusion

We will now prove the main properties of the equality relation.

We start with two lemmas which make it much easier to prove and use
this definition:

** Away from [0]

Before we prove our main results about the equality we have to do some
work on division.  A function is said to be bounded away from zero in
a set if there exists a positive lower bound for the set of absolute
values of its image of that set.

%\begin{convention}% Let [I : IR->CProp], [F : PartIR] and denote by [P]
the domain of [F].

  forall y Hy, (I y) -> c [<=] AbsIR (F y Hy)}.

(**
If [F] is bounded away from zero in [I] then [F] is necessarily apart from zero in [I]; also this means that [I] is included in the domain of [{1/}F].

(**
A function is said to be bounded away from zero everywhere if it is bounded away from zero in every compact subinterval of its domain; a similar definition is made for arbitrary sets, which will be necessary for future work.
