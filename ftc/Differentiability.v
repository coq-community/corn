* Differentiability

We will now use our work on derivatives to define a notion of
differentiable function and prove its main properties.

%\begin{convention}% Throughout this section, [a,b] will be real
numbers with [a [<] b], [I] will denote the interval [[a,b]]
and [F,G,H] will be differentiable functions.
%\end{convention}%

Usually a function [F] is said to be differentiable in a proper
compact interval [[a,b]] if there exists another function [F']
such that [F'] is a derivative of [F] in that interval.  There is a
problem in formalizing this definition, as we pointed out earlier on,
which is that if we simply write it down as is we are not able to get
such a function [F'] from a hypothesis that [F] is differentiable.

However, it turns out that this is not altogether the best definition
for the following reason: if we say that [F] is differentiable in
[[a,b]], we mean that there is a partial function [F'] which is
defined in [[a,b]] and satisfies a certain condition in that
interval but nothing is required of the behaviour of the function
outside [[a,b]].  Thus we can argue that, from a mathematical
point of view, the [F'] that we get eliminating a hypothesis of
differentiability should be defined exactly on that interval.  If we
do this, we can quantify over the set of setoid functions in that
interval and eliminate the existencial quantifier without any
problems.

Definition Diffble_I (a b : IR) (Hab : a [<] b) (F : PartIR) :=
 {f' : CSetoid_fun (subset (Compact (less_leEq _ _ _ Hab))) IR |
  Derivative_I Hab F (PartInt f')}.

End Definitions.

Arguments Diffble_I [a b].

Section Local_Properties.

(**
From this point on, we just prove results analogous to the ones for derivability.

A function differentiable in [[a,b]] is differentiable in every proper compact subinterval of [[a,b]].
