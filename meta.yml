  CoRN includes the following parts:

  - Algebraic Hierarchy

    An axiomatic formalization of the most common algebraic
    structures, including setoids, monoids, groups, rings,
    fields, ordered fields, rings of polynomials, real and
    complex numbers

  - Model of the Real Numbers

    Construction of a concrete real number structure
    satisfying the previously defined axioms

  - Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

    A proof that every non-constant polynomial on the complex
    plane has at least one root

  - Real Calculus

    A collection of elementary results on real analysis,
    including continuity, differentiability, integration,
    Taylor's theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

  - Exact Real Computation

    Fast verified computation inside Coq. This includes: real numbers, functions,
    integrals, graphs of functions, differential equations.

  ## Building and installation instructions

  The easiest way to install the latest released version of C-CoRN
  is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

  ```shell
  opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
  opam install coq-corn
  ```

  To instead build and install manually, you have to start with
  the `bignums` dependency:

  ``` shell
  git clone https://github.com/coq/bignums
  cd bignums
  make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
  make install
  ```

  The last `make install` is necessary, it copies `bignums` to
  a common folder, which is usually `coq/user-contrib`. Afterwards
  the similar commands for `math-classes` will find `bignums` there.
  Finally build `corn` itself:

  ``` shell
  git clone https://github.com/coq-community/corn
  cd corn
  ./configure.sh
  make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
  make install
  ```

  ### Building C-CoRN with SCons

  C-CoRN supports building with [SCons](http://www.scons.org/). SCons is a modern
  Python-based Make-replacement.

  To build C-CoRN with SCons run `scons` to build the whole library, or
  `scons some/module.vo` to just build `some/module.vo` (and its dependencies).

  In addition to common Make options like `-j N` and `-k`, SCons
  supports some useful options of its own, such as `--debug=time`, which
  displays the time spent executing individual build commands.

  `scons -c` replaces Make clean

  For more information, see the [SCons documentation](http://www.scons.org/).

  ### Building documentation

  To build CoqDoc documentation, say `scons coqdoc`.
