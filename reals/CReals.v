* Definition of the notion of reals
The reals are defined as a Cauchy-closed Archimedean constructive
ordered field in which we have a maximum function. The maximum
function is definable, using countable choice, but in a rather tricky
way. Cauchy completeness is stated by assuming a function [lim]
that returns a real number for every Cauchy sequence together with a
proof that this number is the limit.
