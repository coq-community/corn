CoRN includes the following parts:

- Algebraic Hierarchy

  An axiomatic formalization of the most common algebraic
  structures, including setoids, monoids, groups, rings,
  fields, ordered fields, rings of polynomials, real and
  complex numbers

- Model of the Real Numbers

  Construction of a concrete real number structure
  satisfying the previously defined axioms

- Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

  A proof that every non-constant polynomial on the complex
  plane has at least one root

- Real Calculus

  A collection of elementary results on real analysis,
  including continuity, differentiability, integration,
  Taylor's theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

- Exact Real Computation

  Fast verified computation inside Coq. This includes: real numbers, functions,
  integrals, graphs of functions, differential equations.

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of C-CoRN
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-corn
```

To instead build and install manually, you have to start with
the `bignums` dependency:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq/bignums
cd bignums
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
make install
```

The last `make install` is necessary, it copies `bignums` to
a common folder, which is usually `coq/user-contrib`. Afterwards
the similar commands for `math-classes` will find `bignums` there.
Finally build `corn` itself:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/corn
cd corn
./configure.sh
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
make install
```

### Building C-CoRN with SCons

C-CoRN supports building with [SCons](http://www.scons.org/). SCons is a modern
Python-based Make-replacement.

To build C-CoRN with SCons run `scons` to build the whole library, or
`scons some/module.vo` to just build `some/module.vo` (and its dependencies).

In addition to common Make options like `-j N` and `-k`, SCons
supports some useful options of its own, such as `--debug=time`, which
displays the time spent executing individual build commands.

`scons -c` replaces Make clean

For more information, see the [SCons documentation](http://www.scons.org/).

### Building documentation

To build CoqDoc documentation, say `scons coqdoc`.
